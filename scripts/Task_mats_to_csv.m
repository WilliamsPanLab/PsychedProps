function Task_mats_to_csv(subj,sesh,task)

% load in subjseshdose
% load in FD,remTRs from an R export?
% and a binary include from main analyses

% addpaths

% get list of vertices to include for visual (use MW mask and network thresholds)
% get list of vertices to include for motor (use MW mask and network thresholds)

% for each vertex (MAINTAIN OG VERTEX NUMBER 1:2562 FOR CLARITY)

% initialize vertex output, Left and Right

% pull from extract_ang_dif.m

% for each task

% for each subject

% for each session (perhaps not as for loop, but just listing each one)

% end for each session

% end for each subject

% end for each task

% saveout long df for this vertex

% end for each vertex

% THE GOAL IS A LONG DATAFRAME FOR EACH VERTEX, FOR VISUAL (K=2) AND FOR MOTOR (K=3), FOR EACH HEMISPHERE. 
% COLUMNS AS SUBJECT, FRAMEWISE ANGULAR DISTANCE FROM INTONETWORKANGLE, TASK, MEAN FD, REMAINING TRS, DRUG VS. NODRUG
