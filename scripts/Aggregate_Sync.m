% need to devise approach to aggregate each synchrony struct and print out time series in r friendly format. For a mixed effect model, so we'll need it in long format
% i.e., each row is subject sessions task parcel # and starting TR, as well as 25 timepoints in parcel synchrony and 25 timepoints in vector synchrony

% get list of every struct

% load in accordingly
for s=1:lengthStructs
	% load struct
	% get size of struct to add to a table
	% pull subject
	% pull session
	% pull task
	% pull parcel
	% pull starting TR
	% pull BOLD time series
	% pull vetor time series	
end
